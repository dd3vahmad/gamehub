## Features of the app

### UI

Leveraged Chakra UI (by Segun Adebayo)'s beautiful and extensible components to create an accessible and responsive user interface for this app.

### State Management

- Utilized the Context API for efficient global state management
- Used Zustand, a lightweight and performant state management library (Yes, no redux nonsense)

### Routing

Implemented routing client-side routing using React Router v6.

### Tanstack Query..

This was useful for quite a number of useful features in the app

- Infinte queries
- Efficiently managing server state
- Caching (You probably didn't noticed)
- Automatic refetch, retries (is react query not awesome?ðŸ¤—)
